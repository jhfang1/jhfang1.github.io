## Improvement in Coding
My programming skills have improved a lot, especially when it comes to creating and analyzing code a lot. I have an okay understanding of how html and javascript works, and with Assignment one I have learned node.js and the usefulness of it when it comes to making servers.

## Work on
I do think that I have a lot of things that I need to work on. One of them is being able to use a more diverse range of code. I realize now that coding is a lot like a language, where if you do not know how to do something you have to either use a dictionary(manual) or you may find another, very simple but inefficient way of doing things because you cannot remember which commands do which. for of, while, and other similar functions I feel I lack understanding of. I also struggle to comment code properly, and my code often turns out very messy. I also need to study a lot more in how servers work, and gain a bit more depth of how node.js works. I am also really bad at figuring what goes wrong in my code, using console.log etc.. is a really great way to do this. I find that when code doesn't work, I tend to rethink and rewrite entire statements instead of just looking at what is going wrong in the code and rewriting that.

## WODs
I actually really enjoy the Wods. Minus the recording part. I find that they are really helpful, which that it engages you in a way that makes you think from a perspective of, how does this work. I found that for me, the best way to do it was let myself try the wod once, without putting a hard time limit or anything, and let myself go wild on looking up manuals and guides for the code I am about to write. For the most part, I can do it without the screencast, because with google you do not need a screencast. 

## Labs
For me, I was not able to learn a lot from Labs. I am able to complete them with some confidence, however labs feel more of like a passive learning more than an active learning to me. It does not challenge me to think in a way that WODs do (unless the lab has an on your own section), which I feel like simulates a real technology job more than anything. I would like it a lot more if Labs did not have 

## Ready for Assignment 2
I did learn a lot from Assignment2, as not only did it help fill in some of my gaps with HTML and javascript knowledge, but also helped me gain an understanding of how these 2 and node.js all work together. It also helped me realize bugs in my code a lot quicker, and start using methods of debugging a lot more. As for assignment 2, I am not sure, because now that there are no longer any wods, although I feel like if anyone is able to use google and read I feel that all these assignments are achieveable. 

## can this class be improved?
I think so, but catering to everyone specifically and how each person specifically learns is very hard. Personally, I think this class could have touched a bit more on css, instead of focusing only on html and javascript mainly. I do wish that more hands on activities were held in the class instead of just working on the labs. The WODs were very nice, I just wish the requirement for recording yourself doing them did not exist. I wish that tehre was one wod every lab, instead of being spread out. This class could have also used a better schedule, since finding due dates was very difficult, especially with the quizzes that take place.

## Helps me most in the class
I really think that the WODs are the number one thing that helps me most. Not the screencast, because the screencast does not make you think in a way that doing it yourself does. I think the act of looking up manuals or reading documentation while you are coding is the best way to learn, especially because you actively engage in the code. Getting one on one help is very nice, but I do believe that looking things up yourself and being able to succeed in writing a proper line of code is a lot more rewarding, and if something is rewarding it helps you remember it more.
