  <h2 id="briefly-describe-your-system-eg-a-store-selling-pokemon-game-cards">Briefly describe your system (e.g. A store selling Pokemon game cards)</h2>

<p>It is a store that sells japanese snacks, drinks, and alcohol.</p>

<h2 id="any-notable-shortcomings-bugs-problems-or-additional-features-not-implemented">Any notable shortcomings, bugs, problems, or additional features not implemented?</h2>

<p>I have not done the extra credit, the update registration page, and save cart upon relogin.</p>

<h2 id="describe-what-you-are-most-proud-of-about-your-system">Describe what you are most proud of about your system:</h2>

<p>I really like the amazon cart, select the quantity of 10+, and it changes to a text input to put a number.</p>

<h2 id="describe-what-you-are-least-happy-with-your-system">Describe what you are least happy with your system:</h2>

<p>With this cart selection system, I was stuck trying to figure out how to get the subtotal to dynamically recalulate upon every change of quantity in the cart.
I just refreshed the page after every change instead.</p>

<h2 id="how-was-developing-this-assignment-different-than-assignment-2">How was developing this assignment different than assignment #2?</h2>

<p>I had to start using sessions, I changed everything to fetch on the client side, and sessions had to be used to store current cart data.</p>

<h2 id="when-you-ran-into-a-problem-what-did-you-do-to-address-it">When you ran into a problem, what did you do to address it?</h2>

<p>Console.log(variable) everywhere. It helps to keep track and make sure that your code is doing exactly as what you planned.</p>

<h2 id="describe-what-worked-well-in-doing-this-assignment">Describe what worked well in doing this assignment?</h2>

<p>console.log, looking up what sessions did, and also not writing mroe than 3-5 lines of code before testing. Console.log was the biggest one, it helped so much during debugging.</p>

<h2 id="describe-what-did-not-work-well-in-doing-this-assignment">Describe what did not work well in doing this assignment?</h2>

<p>In the beginning, I wanted to rewrite the entire server.js file to make it look cleaner. I think this wasted a lot of time, and I also in the beginning did not follow the 3-5 lines of code rule.</p>

<h2 id="what-did-you-learn-from-doing-this-assignment">What did you learn from doing this assignment?</h2>

<p>Sessions, cookies, how they work, and the fetch api and how flexible it is. I also learned that I should stop coding so much before testing, because then most of my time is spent debugging.</p>

<h2 id="if-you-could-go-back-in-time-and-do-things-differently-what-would-you-change">If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you change?</h2>

<p>I think I should have started way earllier, and just not restart from scratch. I also wish I implemented max age later and used that plugin to autorefresh my node.js upon change, it would have been super quality of life.</p>

<h2 id="estimate-the--of-time-you-spent-a-thinking-about-how-to-do-something-b-writing-code-but-do-not-include-testing-c-testing-and-debugging">Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging</h2>

<p>a) 50
b) 20%
c) 30%</p>

<h2 id="assign-an-estimated-percentage-on-the-amount-each-team-member-contributed-to-the-assignment-including-yourself-and-explain-briefly-your-rationale-for-the-percentage-breakdown-be-sure-to-include-an-overview-of-what-specifically-you-and-your-partners-contributed-eg-i-worked-on-the-security-and-my-partner-1-worked-on-personalization">Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself) and explain briefly your rationale for the percentage breakdown. Be sure to include an overview of what specifically you and your partners contributed (e.g. “I worked on the security and my partner 1 worked on personalization”)</h2>

<p>I worked on this assignment by myself, so I did 100% of the work.</p>
