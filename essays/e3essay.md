## Final Thoughts
I enjoyed these WODs, and although I was unfamiliar with how I was supposed to do them, I think I learned a lot in which how I should go about doing things the next time, and definitely do the reading for them. As for the next WOD's, I am still unsure if I will continue using VIM or switching to VSCode entirely, so I will most likely settle on one by then.
