## WOD1
I think WOD1 was the most time consuming to do because it involved creating an entire website from scratch. This is also amplified by the fact that I did not have VSCode installed on my computer at home, so I resorted to using VIM. I failed about 3 times, and I had to look up some syntax before being able to complete the WOD. I think as long as I know the syntax and get a bit more fluent at using VIM, I should be able to hit the Rx time consistently.
## WOD2
WOD2 was a bit more challenging, since I had never dabbled in css, I did not have prior background knowledge about it. Thus, going in without doing the reading was a terrible idea, and I definitely did not hit the Rx time at all. Once I had read up a bit more on CSS, it was very simple, albeit with the problem that I am still a beginner in vim, so it took me a lot longer than normal.
## WOD3
Finally, for the WOD3, it was also very simple, with  me again being held back by vim. I think using notepad++ or any basic code editor would have been quicker, but I do enjoy not having to move my cursor and leaving my hands solely on my keyboard. I also had the big problem of not being able to load the font after writing the code in the CSS file, and later realized that this was becasue I did not have the font installed. I ended up hitting the Av time for this, just shy of the Rx by 20 seconds.

## Final Thoughts
I enjoyed these WODs, and although I was unfamiliar with how I was supposed to do them, I think I learned a lot in which how I should go about doing things the next time, and definitely do the reading for them. As for the next WOD's, I am still unsure if I will continue using VIM or switching to VSCode entirely, so I will most likely settle on one by then.
