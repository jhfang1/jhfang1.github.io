## Provide a brief introduction to the assignment along with a link to this page for further details

https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/modules/Assignment2/ I assume this is the page. 

For Assignment2, we had to build on top of our webstore that we had created in Assignment1. In addition to fixing any bugs we may have come to realize in Assignment 1, we had to also implement a login system, barring the method of using Sessions and Cookies.

## What did you learn from this assignment?

The challenge for this assignment was learning how POST and FileSync are able to write data, and further transmit data from the server to the client. In addition, I also learned how to clean up my code, dynamically create redirect pages, and further optimize functions. 

## Did you work with a partner? Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself).

I did not work with a partner, however I did call upon the help from a lot of mozilla documentation, using chatgpt to help me get a base of what kind of code is needed for what task I needed to achieve, then building/structuring the code myself. 

## How did you get help when you needed it? What did you need help with?

I got help by looking things up a lot over the internet. It was mainly specific features, like figuring out how to separate query strings, how to rebuild query strings, and how to get hidden input fields to post back data correctly.

## How was developing this assignment different than assignment #1?

This assignment was vastly different from assignment #1, because Assignment #1 when you are just starting out, you feel lost and do not know what to do. After assignment 1, things become a lot clearer and felt easier. From a design perspective, it felt like Assignment 1 was the hard part, becuase there are not many good e-commerce website templates that are simple and easy to understand. 

## Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging

It was mostly 75% thinking about how to do something, 10% writing code, and 15% debugging and fixing code. 

## Describe what worked well with this project? What did not work well?

What worked well was breaking everything down to small steps. For example, if I had a big task that was "Have the registration go through validation in the server, and if successful send the user to the invoice with a customized page and data.

My thinking process will then look like this:
//Create Registration field
//Create validation for registration fields
//parse data back to the URL, send it back as a string and send user to invoice with the string
//If errors, send them back to the same page, with the errors in the URL
//Get the errors from the URL and have it display in the text box
//Find a way to split the errors from the URL while keeping quantities

You get the point.

## If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you do differently?

One thing that I would do differently would be to split up these steps and read a lot more documentation. I would have also wished that I could have started Assignment 1 earlier, so that I could start Assignment 2 earlier, and have more of a headstart on these assignments. I wish I had gone for help if time had allowed for Assignment 1 as well. I also should focus on one task, before moving on to different tasks as me getting sidetracked throughout them had definitely costed me.
