## Introduction

I am in my Junior year at UH Manoa, and per the homepage, am a full-time enrolled student at UH Manoa's Shidler College of Business majoring in MIS and minoring in Japanese. I liked Japanese because I got bored of learning Mandarin as a kid, and wanted to try something new. Ever since then I think it has grown on me more and I hope to pass the N2 test in the future. I also plan on adding Accounting, because working with numbers in spreadsheets is really fun, especially if you attempt to create a formula to make sorting through data a lot easier. It just feels very satisfying, and that is the same thing I get when I work with computers.

## Why MIS?

I chose ITM 352, and MIS as a major in general because I was interested in computers since I was young, and I want to major in Accounting someday, therefore, why not do both? That is what I thought at the time. I do love modding games and trying to discover how they work, so naturally I turned towards MIS since I also plan on Majoring in Accounting as well. Additionally, I hope to be able to bring my skills to bridge the gap between business and technology, as I really enjoyed making spreadsheet applications in my spare time to make entering numbers a lot nicer. I also did not want to take Chemistry and Physics for the BS in Computer Science, and thus I am here in MIS now.
